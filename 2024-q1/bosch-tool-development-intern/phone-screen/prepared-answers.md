## Tell me about your current study and work

On the practical side my study focuses on Data Analytics and Machine Learning methods and technologies. For the academic side, I study mathematics, mainly computing theory and artificial intelligence. I also have experience developing web application, and have started doing limited freelance web design and development during my study. It was not profitable, and I could not find many clients, but it was a valuable learning experience for me to understand the needs of the market. I have also been the project lead and/or SCRUM master for the majority of my student projects and coursework, where I apply my knowledge of Agile software development, mainly a hybrid between SCRUM and Kanban. Throughout my academic career, having the chance to work in an international environment at RMIT, I always place a strong emphasis clear communication, independent initiative, and problem-solving.

Reminder: Agile:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Reminder: 看板（KanBan/Khán Bản）
